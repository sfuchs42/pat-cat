This is a pretty basic quote machine. The quotes are from AFI's top 100 movie quotes, and it was meant to be a quick practice of database calls for display on the frontend. It also allows for user addition to the database.

It's a basic Ruby On Rails application with bootstrap and simple form for formating and adding new quotes.
